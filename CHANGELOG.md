# Changelog

All notable changes to Kagi are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow semver.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **In-app auto-update** (ADR-0082). On startup Kagi checks GitHub Releases in the
  background (best-effort, silent on failure, opt-out via Settings) and shows an
  **"↑ Update vX.Y.Z"** chip in the header when a newer release exists. Clicking it
  opens a modal with the current → latest versions, the platform asset, and the
  **release notes rendered as Markdown**. "Update now" downloads the asset,
  **verifies its SHA-256** against the release checksums, swaps it into the running
  install atomically, and relaunches — or "Skip this version" / "Release page" /
  "Later". Checking is opt-in and silent; installing is always confirmed and
  checksum-verified, writes atomically, and runs no destructive command.
  - Linux installs cleanly; **macOS/Windows are unsigned**, so the OS still warns
    on the relaunched build until code signing lands (ADR-0038 Phase 2). The macOS
    path is verified end-to-end; Linux/Windows install paths are implemented but not
    yet runtime-verified by the maintainers.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Windows build** (x86_64), experimental / best-effort. Releases now ship
  `kagi-<version>-x86_64-windows.zip` (a self-contained `kagi.exe` — assets are
  embedded). The terminal uses `cmd.exe` and settings/avatars/oplog resolve under
  `%USERPROFILE%`. Built and packaged by CI; not yet runtime-verified by the
  maintainers, and unsigned (SmartScreen warns on first launch).

### Fixed
- **Conflict editor, mismatched-length sides.** Scrolling the longer of the two
  panes was clamped to the shorter side's line count (the panes share one scroll
  handle but had unequal row counts); each hunk now blank-pads the shorter side so
  both panes have equal height.
- **Conflict editor, missing context.** The A/B panes skipped non-conflicting
  context lines, so the Merged Result Preview contained lines that were invisible
  in the editor (reading as code at "unexpected positions"). Context lines now
  render on both panes (muted, with real per-side line numbers) and stay aligned,
  so each pane shows the full file and the preview is traceable to what's on screen.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **Could not commit after resolving a merge conflict.** After resolving all
  conflicts and clicking **Continue**, Kagi advanced to the commit panel but the
  commit could not be completed: the resolutions were never staged (the per-file
  Save is optional), so the index kept its unmerged entries — the Commit button
  stayed disabled and the merge commit was refused. Continue now stages the
  resolutions before opening the commit panel, and a resolved merge (MERGE_HEAD
  present, no remaining unmerged entries) is treated as "ready to commit" rather
  than re-entering an empty Conflict Mode, so the commit panel stays put across
  the filesystem-watcher reload that staging triggers. GUI-verified end to end.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-14

This release ships new user-facing features on top of the start of the v1.0
internal re-architecture. See `docs/rearch/` for the architecture work and
`docs/adr/0072`–`0081` for the decisions behind it.

### Added
- **Drag-and-drop branch merge** (ADR-0079, T-DNDMERGE-001). Drag a local-branch
  label — from the commit-graph **BRANCH / TAG** badges *or* the sidebar branch list —
  and drop it onto the current branch to **start** a merge. The dropped label follows
  the cursor; each badge is independently draggable (a commit may carry several
  branches). The drop only opens the merge **preview** (`Merge <source> into <current>`
  with current→predicted state, fast-forward vs merge-commit, conflict prediction) —
  nothing is merged until you confirm. Cancel leaves the repository untouched; on
  conflict it enters the existing Conflict Mode.
- **Settings button + window** (ADR-0080, T-SETTINGS-001). A gear button in the
  window's top-right (also ⌘, / menu bar) opens a settings view (sections for
  Appearance — theme, UI zoom, compact graph — and Language: English / 日本語),
  applied live and persisted to `~/.kagi/settings.json`.
- **Undo / Redo of operations** (ADR-0081, T-UNDOREDO-001). GitKraken-style
  Undo/Redo toolbar buttons that work after commit and merge, implemented as safe,
  reflog-backed branch-ref moves through the plan→confirm→preflight→execute→verify
  pipeline — every move shows a preview first, no commit is ever destroyed, and
  `reset --hard` is never used (undone commits stay recoverable via the reflog).
- **`kagi <repo>` CLI** — `cargo install --path .` puts a self-contained `kagi`
  binary on your `PATH`; `kagi <repo-dir>` opens that repo (no arg → Welcome).
- **Smooth commit** — the Commit button commits immediately (no confirmation
  popup) when the pre-commit checklist finds no blockers; blockers (conflict
  markers / secrets / large binaries) still show the safety modal.

### Fixed
- Integrated **terminal arrow keys** (shell history) and **Escape** (vim/less) now
  work — they were being consumed by global diff/close key bindings.
- Settings window: the top-right gear icon now renders (missing bundled SVG), the
  layout/contrast is correct (rebuilt as a native view), the theme selector is a
  dropdown, and opening Settings no longer panics.
- Header toolbar button cluster is now centered (was right-shifted).

### Changed (internal — v1.0 re-architecture groundwork)
- Extracted a pure **`kagi-domain`** crate (commit/graph/diff/conflict model, rules,
  plan types — zero `git2`/`gpui`) (ADR-0072).
- Introduced a **`Backend` façade** + unified **`Operation`** pipeline; the **UI no
  longer calls `git2` directly** (enforced by a CI grep gate) (ADR-0073/0078).
- Began decomposing the 16.7k-line `ui/mod.rs` god-file (modals, diff view extracted)
  and slimming `main.rs` (ADR-0076/0077).
- Added a **test CI** workflow (`cargo test --workspace` + the UI-git2-free gate);
  the suite stays green at every commit.

## [0.2.0]
- Conflict Mode (line-level 3-pane editor, merge-into-conflict), commit suite,
  repo tabs, themes, EN/JA UI, uniform zoom, integrated terminal, GitHub avatars,
  cross-platform distribution. (See the v0.2.0 release notes / git history.)

## [0.1.0]
- Initial release: commit-graph UX, branch/tag/stash/worktree management, staging +
  commit, cherry-pick / revert / amend / discard with dry-run safety.
